# Introduction-to-Twitter-Analysis-with-R
A short introduction to scraping and analysing Twitter Data with R and exporting it to Gephi

A small workshop I held together with Erik Becker at the Humboldt University Berlin in 2019. We demonstrated the general workflow in scraping and use of Twitter data for the case of the JNU protests in India. 

Erik Becker provided input on the role of Twitter in India, the protests and a qualitative analysis of the some influential tweets and users in the sample. I myself provided the data and an introduction to scraping Twitter data with R, turning it into a network graph and exporting it to Gephi. The presentation was intended for an audience with little to no prior knowledge of R, providing code and examples for an analysis combining quantiative and qualitative methods. 

The presentation, the R markdown used in its creation and the data used can be found in this repository.
